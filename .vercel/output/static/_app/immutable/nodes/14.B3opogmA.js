Introduction and purpose</h2> <p class="mt-2">This Code of Conduct sets out the standards of behaviour expected from learners at HCA. It
				exists to protect the rights and safety of learners and staff, to keep teaching and learning
				effective, and to help learners grow in character.</p> <p class="mt-2">The school uses a positive, restorative approach to discipline wherever possible: we correct,
				teach, reconcile, and restore. Consequences still exist, but they are applied fairly and with a
				view to growth.</p></section> <section><h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900">2.

				measure where safety is at risk, pending investigation. Expulsion is a last resort. Because
				HCA is an independent school, expulsion generally functions as termination of enrolment after a
